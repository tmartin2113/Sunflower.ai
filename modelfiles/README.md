## Hardware Optimization

### Model Variants (Pre-installed on CD-ROM)
```
High-End Systems (16GB+ RAM, dedicated GPU):
└── llama3.2:7b - Full capability, fastest responses

Mid-Range Systems (8-16GB RAM):
└── llama3.2:3b - Balanced performance and quality

4. **Safety Redirect**: Convert inappropriate topics to STEM learning
5. **Parent Flagging**: Mark concerning patterns for review

### Redirection Examples
- Violence/Weapons → Physics of forces and motion
- Inappropriate Content → Biology and health education
- Dangerous Activities → Safety in science experiments
- Social Drama → Psychology and communication skills
- Gaming Addiction → Computer science and time management

## Family Profile System

### Profile Structure
```json
{
  "family_id": "unique_identifier",
  "parent_auth": "encrypted_password_hash",
  "children": [
    {
      "name": "child_name",
      "age": "numeric_age",
      "grade": "grade_level",
      "interests": ["science", "math"],
      "restrictions": ["specific_topics"],
      "learning_history": "encrypted_log_reference"
    }
  ],
  "created": "timestamp",
  "last_modified": "timestamp"
}
```
